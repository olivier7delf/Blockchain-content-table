Explain briefly the purpose of each blockchain project.

It is divided in 3 categories:
1. Courses:
   - on Coursera: A specialisation in Blockchain: 4 courses
   - on Udemy: 2 courses to master Solidity, web3 and Dapp
2. Project: 
   - Decentralized Carpooling deployed with an interface
3. Training:
   - Security and Audit
   - Protocols and topics mastered
